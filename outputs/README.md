# Outputs overview

Each figure in `outputs/figures/` now has a matching caption file under `outputs/figures/captions/` with a short explanation and a brief analysis of this run’s result.

Highlights from this run:
- Baseline vs Semi (thresholded): both at accuracy=0.90, precision=0.90, recall=0.90 with threshold policy = constrained — recall-first selection found a feasible high threshold with moderate FPR (0.10).
- Threshold sweeps (TPR≈1.0): baseline best FPR=0.20 (precision 0.83), semi best FPR=0.60 (precision 0.63), showing the practical cost of forcing TPR to 1.0.
- Clustering: best K-Means k=3 on PCA cluster space achieved ARI≈0.415, NMI≈0.404; silhouette≈0.10 indicates moderate separation. DBSCAN collapsed to all-noise for tested ε/min_samples; k-distance shows no clear elbow.
