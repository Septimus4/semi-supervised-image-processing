Description

This dataset includes a total of 1,500 images:
1,400 unlabeled images
100 labeled images

The labeled images are divided into two categories:
Normal: Images of healthy brains.
Cancer: Images of brains showing signs of tumors.

Image Features

All images have been resized to a standardized size of 512 Ã— 512 pixels. This standardization ensures their compatibility with various image processing and machine learning pipelines. They are saved in the common JPEG (.jpg) image format.
Potential Applications

This dataset can be used for a wide range of applications, including:
Training and evaluating various deep learning models (e.g., DenseNet201, YOLOv8x/s, CNN, ResNet50v2, VGG-16, MobileNetV2).
The development of image classification algorithms for the detection and classification of brain tumors.
Conducting research in medical image analysis and artificial intelligence applied to the healthcare field.
